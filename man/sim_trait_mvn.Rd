\title{Simulate traits from a kinship matrix under the infinitesimal model}
\usage{
sim_trait_mvn(
  rep,
  kinship,
  herit,
  mu = 0,
  sigma_sq = 1,
  labs = NULL,
  labs_sigma_sq = NULL,
  tol = 1e-06
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep}{The number of replicate traits to simulate.
Simulating all you need at once is more efficient than simulating each separately (the kinship matrix is eigendecomposed once per run, shared across replicates).}

\item{kinship}{The \code{n}-by-\code{n} kinship matrix of the individuals to simulate from.}

\item{herit}{The desired heritability (proportion of trait variance due to genetics).}

\item{mu}{The desired parametric mean value of the trait (scalar, default 0).}

\item{sigma_sq}{The desired parametric variance factor of the trait (scalar, default 1).
Corresponds to the variance of an outbred individual.}

\item{labs}{Optional labels assigning individuals to groups, to simulate environment group effects.
Values can be numeric or strings, simply assigning the same values to individuals in the same group.
If vector (single environment), length must be number of individuals.
If matrix (multiple environments), individuals must be along rows, and environments along columns.
The environments are not required to be nested.
If this is non-\code{NULL}, then \code{labs_sigma_sq} must also be given!}

\item{labs_sigma_sq}{Optional vector of environment effect variance proportions, one value for each environment given in \code{labs} (a scalar if \code{labs} is a vector, otherwise its length should be the number of columns of \code{labs}).
Ignored unless \code{labs} is also given.
As these are variance proportions, each value must be non-negative and \code{sum(labs_sigma_sq) + herit <= 1} is required so residual variance is non-negative.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance factor for an internal test of positive semi-definiteness of the trait covariance matrix.
Procedure fails if any eigenvalues are smaller than \code{-tol} times the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue.
Increase this value only if you are getting errors but you're sure your covariance matrix (the output of \code{\link[=cov_trait]{cov_trait()}}) is positive semi-definite.}
}
\value{
A \code{rep}-by-\code{n} matrix containing the simulated traits along the rows, individuals along the columns.
}
\description{
Simulate matrix of trait replicates given a kinship matrix and model parameters (the desired heritability, group effects, total variance scale, and mean).
Although these traits have the covariance structure of genetic traits, and have heritabilities that can be estimated, they do not have causal loci (an association test against any locus should fail).
Below \code{n} is the number of individuals.

\examples{
# create a dummy kinship matrix
# make sure it is positive definite!
kinship <- matrix(
    data = c(
        0.6, 0.1, 0.0,
        0.1, 0.5, 0.0,
        0.0, 0.0, 0.5
    ),
    nrow = 3
)
# draw simulated traits (matrix)
traits <- sim_trait_mvn( rep = 10, kinship = kinship, herit = 0.8 )
