	abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, {SNPs} identified by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis ({GCTA}), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. {GCTA} estimates the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular {SNP} to the trait. We introduce {GCTA}'s five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from {SNPs}, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the {SNPs}, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and {GWAS} simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The {GCTA} software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large {GWAS} data sets.},
