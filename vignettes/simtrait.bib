	abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, {SNPs} identified by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis ({GCTA}), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. {GCTA} estimates the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular {SNP} to the trait. We introduce {GCTA}'s five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from {SNPs}, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the {SNPs}, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and {GWAS} simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The {GCTA} software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large {GWAS} data sets.},

	abstract = {Estimation of narrow-sense heritability, h(2), from genome-wide {SNPs} genotyped in unrelated individuals has recently attracted interest and offers several advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods. With the use of this approach, it has been estimated that over half the heritability of human height can be attributed to the {\textasciitilde}300,000 {SNPs} on a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only 5\%-10\% can be explained by {SNPs} reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in {SNP}-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) between {SNPs}: contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high {LD} and are underestimated in regions of low {LD}. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which {SNPs} are weighted according to local {LD}. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our {LD} adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high {LD} in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed {LDAK}, software for computing {LD}-adjusted kinships.},
